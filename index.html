            Bringing some 'Nighttime Sunshine' to the cloudy town of Portland,
            Oregon, Tenants is a three-piece act of non-homeowners.

            The debut full length album, ‘Nighttime Sunshine,’ is a true feat of
            collaboration, and manages to embody the three distinct musical
            voices of each member. At the heart of the record, lies a bold
            fusion of genres - from the infectious rhythms of disco, the emotive
            melodies of synth-pop, to the smooth sounds of yacht rock, and the
            raw energy of alt rock.

            Tenants worked alongside Portland producer Cameron Spies (Night
            Heron, Radiation City ) and together they merged many diverse
            influences and aesthetics into a cohesive sound that feels both
            nostalgic and refreshingly new.
